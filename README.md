## DiceOnFlow: An on-chain dice generator

 - DiceOnFlow asks you for two things: type of dice and number of dice, and based on your query, it generates the dice values in the trusted way, on-chain. So, you can now enjoy your games without any fear of fraud. It also provides you with an API endpoint to integrate the dice generator into your game.

 - I have also shown an example game, BetOnFlow, Where you can bet your flow token on the outcome of the dice and win a 2Xâ€“6X return on your investment.

## FlowCandy: Soulbound tokens for access pass

 - FlowCandy - A platform to create a Candy (soulbound NFT tokens with expiry date). You can distribute the candies to your community as access pass, Proof-of-Knowledge, hackathon rewards, contrinutor recognition, PoAP, etc.
 - The USP of Candies are the expiry date, which make them comsumable within the given timeframe only.
